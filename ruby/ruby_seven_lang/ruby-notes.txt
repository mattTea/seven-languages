'irb' to enter the Ruby console
'exit' to exit Ruby console

'Single quotes' = literal
"Double quotes" = interpreted

= is for assignment
== tests for equality

everything but nil and false evaluate to true (including 0!)

&& and || interpreter will execute code only until teh value of the test is clear
& and | to compare while executing the whole expression

def defines a function but doesn't execute it
and Ruby does not type check until execution (runtime)... dynamic typing

duck typing... think this means coercing types (i.e. adding a float to an int is ok)

Arrays
animals[-2] returns the element second from the end of the array

Code blocks {} or do/end used for iteration, to delay execution, to conditionally execute something

CONVENTIONS
-----------

Classes start with capital letters and use CamelCase
Must prepend instance variable with @
Instance variables and method names begin with lower case in underscore_style
Constants are ALL_CAPS
Functions and methods that test typically use a question mark (if test?)


A module is a collection of functions and constants (Java, for example, uses 'interfaces' instead of modules)
